Collection of Emacs packages I either "officially" maintain (desktop-menu), or
found elsewhere in an unsatisfactory state and felt interested enough to try to make
them better.

Branches:
master -- contains what I really consider better (or just (usefully) different,
as is the case with cal-china-x) and shareable versions (apart from those "Inital
commit/import", in which case I usually have (sometimes considerable) changes
in my work tree, but it's still too much work in progress -- basically those
should be in priv, but are not, because there was no priv yet when I have
already published master), and can be expected not to be rebased

priv -- WIP, just in case someone was interested; anything can happen there...
(but still not *everything* -- I have the bad habit (I hope I'll get rid of in
the end) of occasionally accumulating a lot in work tree and only then
splitting it up into commits)

As always, comments welcome.
