;;; Commentary:
(defgroup file-journal nil
  "File-journal keeps a list of all the files you have visited, like
a persistent most-recently viewed list.  You can control the number
of days to keep the journal for.  You can also set some file patterns
to exclude from tracking.

Work with files as usual and use `M-x fj-show' to revisit them later
by date.")

;;; Change Log:
;; (see also repository history at the URL above)
;;
;; v 0.5 ?
;; IMPORTANT: `fj-journal' renamed to `fj--journal', so if you don't
;;         want to lose your journal data, evaluate the following:
;;         (setq fj--journal fj-journal)
;;         Also, the default value of fj-journal-file changed, so if
;;         you haven't customized it, you might have to load it manually
;;         and possibly to adjust the value.
;;
;;       - other similar renames: `fj-update-fj-buffer', `fj-file-in-excluded',
;;         `fj-record-file'
;;
;;       Other changes:
;;       - `fj--attach-with-anything' -> `fj--add-anything-source'
;;       - "*file-journal*" -> "*File-Journal*"
;;       - use `find-file-hook' instead of advice to track opened files
;;       - comment out the unimplemented `fj-visit-files' definition
;;       - improve the integration with `anything'
;;       - use "~/.emacs.d/.file-journal" as the default value of
;;         `fj-journal-file' to not pollute users' home directory
;;       - set `fj-exclude-files' default to "TAGS$"
;;       - add some library headers
;;       - general cleanup (code, formatting, whitespace, docstrings, comments)
;;
;; v 0.4 - Small optimization to make the exclusion not suck
;;       - Integration with anything
;;
;; v 0.3 - Added a timer that saves the journal once an hour.
;;       - Added a code to refresh the *file-journal* buffer
;;         when a new file is visited.
;;
;; v 0.2 - Changes by Jonathan Arkell
;;       - Minor fixes to allow for vars to be customizeable
;;       - Added an exclusion list
;;
;; v 0.1 - First release by Tamas

;; TODO:
;; - turn the functionality into a proper minor mode(?)
;; - Hook into, or replace ECB's previous files list.
;; - Open more files at once


;; Tested on Emacs 22 and 23.
