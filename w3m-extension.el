;; `basic-edit-toolkit' `lazycat-toolkit' `wget' `org-compat'

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; A collection of functions that extend functionality of emacs-w3m.
;;

;;; Change log:
;;
;;      2010/02/23
;;              Code cleanup.
;;
;;              Rename `w3m-emacswiki-view-regexp' to
;;              `w3m-view-regexp-url'; the functionality is general,
;;              has nothing to do with EmacsWiki in particular.
;;              Similarly:
;;              `w3m-gmail-toggle-mark' -> `w3m-form-toggle-marks'
;;              `w3m-gmail-mark-all' -> `w3m-form-mark-all'
;;
;;              Remove redundant `w3m-gmail-unmark-all'
;;
;;              `w3m-auto-logon-gmail' -> `w3m-goto-gmail'
;;              `w3m-gmail-login-string' -> `w3m-gmail-login-url'
;;              `w3m-search-advance' -> `w3m-search-plus'
;;              `w3m-search-emacswiki-random' -> `w3m-goto-emacswiki-random'
;;              `w3m-search-advance-search-object' -> `w3m-search-plus-search-term'
;;              `toggle-w3m-with-other-buffer' -> `w3m-toggle-with-other-buffer'
;;              prettyfy -> prettify
;;
;;              Remove some useless comments.
;;
;;              Fix docstrings.
;;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;      2008/09/24
;;              Remove function `w3m-search+' and replace with `w3m-search-advance'
;;
;;      2008/09/22
;;              Add functions: `w3m-goto-linknum' `w3m-gmail-toggle-mark'
;;              `w3m-gmail-mark-all' `w3m-gmail-unmark-all'.
;;
;;      2008/08/30
;;              Add function `w3m-search+', and modified some old search function
;;              to make these base on `w3m-search+'.
;;
;;      2008/08/28
;;              Add two function `w3m-search-slang' and `w3m-search-slang+'.
;;
;;      2008/07/20
;;              Modified some function about Google search.
;;
;;              Make all search function open new search result page in background session.
;;
;;              Extension function `w3m-search-dict-cn+' and `w3m-search-google-web+' to make
;;              them can search current mark sentence.
;;
;;      2008/06/18
;;              Replace some `w3m-goto-url-new-session' with `w3m-view-this-url-1'
;;              to make pages is open background and don't wink screen case by 'w3m-goto-url-new-session.
;;
;;              Add some function that make can jump between Google search titles.
;;
;;      2008/06/17
;;              Add function that return the random pages from EmacsWiki.
;;
;;      2008/06/07
;;              Create this collect of search function. ^_^
